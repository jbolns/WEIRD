## Blog entry from a MARKDOWN document
This blog post was written in markdown. It exists as an .md file which gets converted into HTML as part of WEIRD's build process.

### Headings and subheadings work

Unordered lists also work:

* Item
* Item
* Item

You can thrown in ordered lists, too:

1. Item 1
3. Item 2
3. Item 3

Words and segments can be formatted **bold** and *italics*.

As is usual with markdown, you can also use HTML tags, such as <u>underlining</u>, <s>strikethrough</s>, and <sup>sup</sup> and <sub>sub</sub> effects.[^1]

### What about images?
Yes, images work!

You can include is using standard markdown format and it will get converted into HTML during the build.

As example, hereâ€™s an image of an AI chicken crossing the road. We legit cannot remember the prompt we used to generate it, so you're going to have to live without it.
