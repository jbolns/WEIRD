## What is WEIRD?

</div>

WEIRD is a multi-modal web framework.

It converts documents (HTML, markdown, or even Word documents) into websites through a series of Python-meets-JS shenanigans.

Yeah, we get it. WEIRD is weird. But it can easily produce surprisingly good (and fairly sustainable) websites from little more than just a few documents (even Word documents!).

Download and try WEIRD from its [dedicated GitHub repo](https://github.com/jbolns/WEIRD).

*If we were better at marketing, we'd say something like **'blogging reinvented'**.*

## Use cases
### Small to medium websites.
WEIRD generates static websites, even from Word documents. These are excellent for SME websites, portfolios, project sites, event websites, documentation pages, marketing websites, and landing pages.

### Painless blogging
Since WEIRD is multi-modal, you can design key sections using HTML, CSS, JS, and markdown, yet blog easily by simply uploading Word documents.

### Sustainable websites
WEIRD can produce more sustainable websites that emit less carbon emissions than the average. WEIRD is therefore optimal for anyone interested in the environment and/or demonstrating a commitment to sustainability.
