    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>WEIRD is brought to you by the single-person team from <a href='https://www.polyzentrik.com/'
        target='_blank'>polyzentrik.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Like it? Great!</p>
    <p>Don't like it? Not great. I was really hoping you did.</p>
    <p>But you can't argue with results. WEIRD can produce incredibly fast websites, even from Word documents.
      Additionally, if you use it well, it can give you pages that are incredibly sustainable, which I think is very
      cool.</p>
    <p>It will also become easier to set up and use over time.</p>
    <p>The preferred contact method is any of the social media channels linked in the top bar. That said, if you
      absolute must, you can also contact us via <a href='mailto: hello@polyzentrik.com?SUBJECT=WEIRD made me do it!' target='_blank'

    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>WEIRD is currently in version Beta -7.</p>
    <p>It works, but it hasn't been stress tested sufficiently, so it might probably fail in various different manners.</p>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>Subject to change, the priorities in the coming future are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bug hunting and bug fixing</li>
      <li>Support for additional document types</li>
      <li>Integration with popular cloud providers</li>
      <li>Better documentation. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's open source, so feel free to lend a hand or financial support.</p>
