    <h2>What is WEIRD?</h2>
    <p>WEIRD is a <strong><span class='highlight'>multi-modal</span> web framework</strong>.</p>
    <p>It converts documents (HTML, markdown, or even <em>Word</em> documents) into websites through a series of
      Python-meets-JS shenanigans.</p>
    <p>Yeah, we get it. <u>WEIRD is weird</u>.</p>
    <p>But it can easily produce surprisingly good (and fairly sustainable) websites from little more than just a few
      documents (even Word documents!).</p>
    <p>Download and try WEIRD from its <a href='https://github.com/jbolns/WEIRD' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>dedicated GitHub repo</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <p class='special'>> If we were better at marketing, we'd say something like 'blogging reinvented'.</p>
