  <h2>Blog entry from an HTML document</h2>
  <p>This blog post was written in HTML. It exists as an .html file which gets included in the final website as part of
    WEIRD's build process.</p>
  <p>Obviously, HTML gives you the most freedom when it comes to the ability to include things. If there's an HTML tag
    for
    it, you probably can use it.</p>

  <h3>Headings and subheadings work just fine</h3>

  <p>Unordered lists also work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item</li>
    <li>Item</li>
    <li>Item</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can thrown in ordered lists, too:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Words and segments can be formatted <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italics</em>, and all the standard HTML tags
    work:
    <u>underlining</u>, <s>strikethrough</s>, and <sup>sup</sup> and <sub>sub</sub> effects, just to name a few.
  </p>

  <p>Links work just fine too. Here's a <a href="../">to our home page</a>.</p>

  <h3>What about images?</h3>
  <p>Of course. It's HTML. Images work.</p>

  <p>Simply use the standard approach you would use in HTML.</p>
